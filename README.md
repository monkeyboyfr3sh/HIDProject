# HIDProject
This is a project to create software that will be executed on a device connected to a pc and interface with HID protocol

## Goals
- **(5/9/2020)** Create a device that will run my software that will adjust system volume and react to system volume changes. 
This interaction should happen solely thorugh HID protocol so the device can operate across many platforms.
May add future goals to increase capabilites.
